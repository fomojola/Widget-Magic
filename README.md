# WordPress Widget Magic

Implements a set of WordPress shortcodes and theme additions that allow widget content (initially just sidebars but eventually any text) to be used in any page or post using simple shortcodes.

## Usage

For a sidebar:

    [show_sidebar id="<sidebar id>"]

### Attributes
- *id*: the id of the sidebar to be shown.
